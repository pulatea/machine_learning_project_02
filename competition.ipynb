    "\n",
    "Download the data from [competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/t/664260fab9b04f699426b48a29ff7d05). This is also where you will upload your submissions."

    "You need to improve the accuracy of the model as much as you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules:\n",
    "1. Do not use any external data **NOR** models pre-trained on other datasets\n",
    "2. Use the test set **ONLY** to get predictions for your model. For example, do not use it to compute statistics or features (e.g. learning preprocessing).\n",
    "3. Do not use deep learning models for a fair competition\n",
    "4. Don't cheat :)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "Here are several techniques that you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tune your hyper-parameters** Try `GridSerachCV` function from `sklearn.model_selection` to find the best set of hyperparameters.\n",
    "2. **Feature engineering** Play with the representation of the textual data. We only tried one, but there are more (e.g. TF-IDF Vectorizer is another powerful method to transform text to a vector, taking into account the rareness of the words across the texts). Also do not hesitate to play with the arguments of the *Vectorizers*. \n",
    "3. **Change your model** You are not restricted to train `LogisticRegression` only. You can use whatever algorithm you're already familiar with. Moreover, you can use the algorithms that you get to know during these 3 weeks of solving this assignment. E.g. give *RandomForests* a try!\n",
    "4. **Use date** You can also use the date as extra features, think how you can use it and look for some patterns!\n",
    "5. **Combine multiple models** You can train multiple models and use their individual predictions to produce a final, improved prediction."
